      <p>
        I'm still working on this page, but if you'd like to have me come speak at your conference or do a private workshop at your work, please get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:hey@wesbos.com">hey@wesbos.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>I usually like to speak about JavaScript, CSS, Hot Tips, React.js, Node.js and related topics. For workshops, I have pre-made workshops on Gatsby.js, React.js and several other topics. I am able to create custom workshops tailored towards your team.</p>
      <p>Soon this page will have links to past + upcoming speaking and training events.</p>
