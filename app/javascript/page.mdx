# JavaScript Notes &amp; Reference

Hey! Welcome to my Beginner JavaScript Notes + Reference.

These notes are a free resource, based on my <a href="https://BeginnerJavaScript.com"> Beginner JavaScript Video course </a>. They can be used as a stand alone guide, along with the videos or a quick reference for all the different parts of JavaScript like the <a href="/javascript/02-functions/different-ways-to-declare-functions"> different ways to declare a function</a>.

The code written in these notes is available in the <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/beginner-javascript"> Beginner JavaScript repo</a> on github.

Did I miss something? Think you could add a better example? Find a spelling mistake? All the notes are open source and edits are greatly appreciated!
